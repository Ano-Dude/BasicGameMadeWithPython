First time making a game with Python
////Basic game (veeeeery basic) with Python///
>>Requirements:

     + Windows

     + Python (Download at: https://www.python.org/)

>>Controls (You should input not keystrokes):

+ 'r' = go right

+ 'l' = go left

+ 'j' = jump

+ 'rj' = right-jump

+ 'lj' = left-jump

+ 'exit' = to exit ofc

And I will continue updating the script from time to time. ^^
